task_system
===========

a task system to categorize tasks and ready them for distribution, possibly workflow control and quality control. This can be used for crowdsourcing inside or outside a corporation, together with the badge system. If used inside a corporation, it is a new management system and an infrastructure to build a learning organization. If used outside, it helps build a certificate system in each industry, so people get certified automatically as they complete tasks.
